# bFreeOrgan
### A free Organ Synthesizer based on STM32F4.
**by Franco Caspe**

bFreeOrgan is an open source plattform for Additive Synthesis based on the well-regarded and low-cost Cortex M4 Microcontroller.
As of today, the plattform is used to implement a Drawbar Organ Synthesizerthat currently works with the STM32F407 Discovery board.
This project started in 2017, coded in C with STM32 Standard Peripheral Driver, using System Workbench for STM32 as IDE.

### Project state
Last August (2018), the project received a major bump up, on which PCB and Code were updated to work with an external 16 bit DAC,
isolated from the microcontroller internal noise/interference.

This repo currently contains the source and System Workbench project, KiCad project for the Main PCB and some calibration utils.
The Drawbar Board has not been ported to KiCad. Will be available soon!
3D Print Case is still pending! But, with a little creativity this project can be built! (see images)
