# bFreeOrgan
A free Organ Synthesizer based on STM32F4.

This is the official repo of bFreeOrgan for STM32F4.

bFreeOrgan is an open-source Drawbar Organ Synthesizer 
that currently works with the STM32F407 Discovery board.
It was written in 2017, coded in C with the Standard Peripheral Driver,
using System Workbench for STM32 as IDE.

This repo currently contains the source and System Workbench project.
The makefile will be added in short.

The hardware is currently on revision and will be added later, as it has to be ported to KiCad,
and some issues has to be addressed before release. Anyway, the schematics will be released in no time.

I also will be posting some videos on youtube... links will be here soon!
